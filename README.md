# AMNH Science Research Mentoring Program 2021 - 2022 
Part of the Science Research Mentorship Program (2021-2022) at the American Museum of Natural History studying microbiomes of microbial eukaryotes.

Our project **"Microbial Matryoshka Dolls: Hunting for Microbes in Microbes"** used a combination of light-based microscopy, amplicon sequencing (QIIME), and analyses of single-cell RNA-seq sequencing data (scripts for the latter we developed together and stored here).
