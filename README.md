Part of the Science Research Mentorship Program (2021-2022) at the American Museum of Natural History studying microbiomes of microbial eukaryotes.

Our project "Microbial Matryoshka Dolls: Hunting for Microbes in Microbes" used a combination of amplicon-based (QIIME) approaches along with analyses of single-cell RNA-seq sequencing, the latter we developed together and stored here.
